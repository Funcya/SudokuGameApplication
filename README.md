This is a university project as part of the object oriented programming course, developed in collaboration with my project partner. The development of the project followed specific requirements outlined by the course.

Short summary of the assignment: 
The task is to create a Sudoku application in Java. The program allows users to generate puzzles, select difficulty levels, save and load games, validate inputs, and get hints. 
The user interface is built with JavaFX, and game states are saved using object serialization. The solution emphasizes clean code and object-oriented principles.
